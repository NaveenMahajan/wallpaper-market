# Wallpaper Market - Full Premium Version

This repository contains a full-stack starter for a wallpaper marketplace:
- Frontend: Vite + React + Tailwind (deploy to Netlify)
- Backend: Vercel Serverless functions (under `api/`) providing Stripe Checkout and HD asset delivery
- Admin UI: simple admin page (frontend) to mark images as HD-available
- Demo secure delivery: HD URL endpoint checks a simple purchases.json (demo DB)

**Important**: Replace Stripe keys and set environment variables as instructed in the docs.

See `DEPLOY.md` for deploy steps.
